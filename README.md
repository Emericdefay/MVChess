##How to use
#### 1. Help
There are several commands available in this program, at any time you can check them by typing :
```
commands
```
#### 2. Basics usage
Basically, few commands are needed to manage a tournament.
First, you need to create a tournament. So use :
```
new tournament
```
It will ask an ID to give, make sure to give an integer. That will be the ID of this <br> 
tournament. After that, you'll have to give:
- a name
- a place
- date(s)
- number of players
- number of rounds
- the amount of time for each round 
- a description


Then, it will ask you for the players that will play this tournament. <br>
If a player is already recorded in the data base, ID will be enough. <br>
Else, it will ask you:
- a last name
- a first name
- a birthday
- gender
- elo rank


After that, the first round is ready to start.<br>
Once the round is finished, You have to set the results. For that, type:
```
set round
```
It will ask you the ID of the tournament.<br>
After that, you just have to set the results asked on the terminal.
The tournament is now ready to get a new round, so type 
```
new round
```
When everything is up to. It will ask an ID of a tournament.<br>
You can also add a new player to your data base outside of the tournament creation with:
```
new player
```
But you won't be able to add the player to it.
Now, you know how to manage a Chess tournament with this program.
#### 3. Advanced usage
You know how to manage a tournament but you may want to look at previous <br>
tournaments, checking previous results or players' rank.
Before anything, you have to understand the structure of IDs.
- An ID of a tournament is like : "integer_tournament"
- An ID of a round is like : "integer_tournament":"integer_round"
- An ID of a match is like : "integer_tournament":"integer_round":"integer_match"


Because Match BELONG TO Round BELONG TO Tournament. <br>
So if you want to check the match **nÂ°4** of the **second** round of the tournament **3**, <br> 
the ID of this specific match will be : **3:2:4**

So now, when you'll use a function, you'll know what the program needs as an ID.

We can now look at those functions:
###### Checkout all players:
If you want to see every players recorded on this program, you can type:
```
get players -all -alpha
get players -all -rank
```
The flags -alpha/-rank will sort players depending on which flag chosen.
###### Checkout players from a tournament:
If you want check played from a specific tournament, you can type:
```
get players -alpha
get players -rank
```
The flags -alpha/-rank will sort players depending on which flag chosen.
###### Checkout tournament(s):
If you want to see all information from a tournament or all of them, you can type:
```
